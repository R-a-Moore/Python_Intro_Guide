![Python logo](https://www.python.org/static/img/python-logo.png)

1. First step is to download [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Any version after 3.6 is fine.
2. Open the .exe and follow the steps, until done.
3. Then open powershell in your windows browser as admin and type `python --version`. It should tell you what version of python you have. This is to confirm it's install correctly. If Errors occur, download python form the Microsoft store instead, and run the code again. 


4. Next, download [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows), specifically the community edition. any edition after 2020 is fine.

Now that both of those are installed, open pycharm and create a new project. If it automatically provides a base interpreter in the Python Interpreter tab just press create. If not you must find the appropriate python interpreter, which should be in your files and will be called 'python.exe'.
